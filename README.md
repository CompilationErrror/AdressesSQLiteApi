# Project with ASP.NET Core 6 and SQLite db

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Nikita. This task was a real challange for me, as I was not familiar with the technologies that I had to use. 
However, I did not give up and completed 2/3 of the task. 
Knowledge of LINQ, threading, OOP and understanding of the principles of working with databases helped me a lot.
  1. __First task:__  
    I think that I fully completed all the tasks, despite the complexity.  
  2. __Second task:__  
    Unfortunately, I used \"switch\" and if because I didn't manage to implement the task in a different way.  
Nevertheless, the task was completed.  
  3. __The third task remained unsolved for several reasons:__
  - __I could not understand how to implement the task and what technology to solve it__
  - __I decided to meet the deadlines__  
  
In general, I think that my code is not perfect in some places, but the application functions without failures.  
So, hope your company will help me to improve my skills\:)

## How to use application
Using the application is very simple as it has a convenient and intuitive interface thanks to Swagger.
The application is quite simple to run even without debugging and you will have a new page in the browser.
Next, you will see the following commands for data manipulation:
  - __Post__ \- the command adds an address to the database (all fields are required)
  - __Get__ \- returns a list of all addresses in the database
  - __Get{id}__ \- returns the address at the specified index
  - __Put{id}__ \- provides the ability to edit the address at the specified index
  - __Delete{id}__ \- deletes the address at the specified index 
    
All changes are reflected in the database
Overloading the Get method \- you can specify the name of the field by which all addresses will be sorted, as well as the sorting direction ( 1 - ascending, 2 - descending)  
Happy using!
